              <blockquote><p>The overseas conference participants can come to New Zealand on a visitor visa to attend the conference. For visa waiver countries they will simply be granted a visitor visa on arrival. For visa required countries they will need to apply for a visitor visa before coming. To apply they use the standard visitor visa form, and when asked for the purpose of their visit they should indicate that they are coming here to attend a conference. If they are applying online they need to indicate they are applying for a <b>General Visitor Visa</b> and then in the "What is the purpose of your visit to New Zealand" question they need to select the <b>conference/convention</b> option.</p></blockquote>
